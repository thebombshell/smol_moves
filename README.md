# Smol Moves
A lightweight game engine in C89 &amp; OpenGL, used to challenge myself and fuel "for fun" projects, with a target of
small redistributable size and restricted feature set.

### Return of October 2019
It has been well over a year since I've touched this project but I've been combing through my old projects and decided
to give this one another swing, the restriction was fun to work with and I think has done quite well for my programming
fundimentals in efficient and readable code design.

I hope to make a small tank game while using and expanding smol, in the vein of pop'n tanks and shin-combat choro q.
